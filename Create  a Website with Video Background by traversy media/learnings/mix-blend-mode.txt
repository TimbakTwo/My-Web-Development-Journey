background: red;'
mix-blend-mode: overlay;

// so what this does?




// example
-- your whole article has a z-index of 1
then a big blue background is covering your whole article because
it has z-index set to 2, basically what mix-blend-mode: overlay do
is it's like a glorified version of setting transparency like the rgba
alpha or opacity 0.5 for example to make it good while making the
big blue background transparent so you can see the article
covered with overlay aesthetically and more pleasing, try it or search
google for more info.
