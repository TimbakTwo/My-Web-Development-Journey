if the html element is already at left 0 at default you still need
to set the element position to left 0 or the transition will not work

for example

.box1 {
 position: absolute;
 left: 0; // if you don't set this, the transition will not work
 transition: 1s;
}

.box1:hover {
 left: 100px;
}
