a {
	display: inline-block;
}

to be sure, search this on google

but for me the reason is, when you don't set an <a> html tag
display: inline-block, their default display is display: inline, 
you should set them to display: inline-block or else if you set
transform: scale(0.5) like that or width,height,margin,padding, if you 
set that for example and it doesn't work I think you need to set
it to display: inline-block;
