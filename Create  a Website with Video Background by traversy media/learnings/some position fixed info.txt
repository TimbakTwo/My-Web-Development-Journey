position: fixed;

go to the tutorial remake project go to styles.css
modify the .bgVideo from position: absolute to fixed and see what will happen

for example 

for example a video element is inside the parent element 
when you move the parent element position while the video background
element which is the children element is positioned absolute the video
element will move also, but when the children video element is positioned 
fixed,
it will not follow the position of it's parent element unless you specify
expllcitly the position of the video element also.
